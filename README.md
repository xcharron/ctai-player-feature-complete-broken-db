# CTAI Mobile Player â€“ Feature-Complete Version (Broken Supabase)

This is the most feature-complete version of the CallTuneAI mobile player, built with React Native and Expo.  
It includes the latest UI/UX updates but still references a removed Supabase backend.

## ðŸ”§ Current Status
- Supabase integration is broken (Supabase project was deleted)
- Login may still reference Supabase logic
- Includes volume slider and sound playback fixes (double-tap issue may be resolved)
- Built with Expo and EAS
- Bluetooth and offline audio features are present

## âœ… Use Case
Use this version as a **reference for re-implementing** auth or merging into a stable build.

## ðŸš§ To-Do (For Dev)
- Remove or replace Supabase calls
- Rebuild or disable login screen flow
- Validate audio functions (test player bugs)
